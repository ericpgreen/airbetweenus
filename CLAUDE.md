# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**The Air Between Us** is a Duke University global health Century Course repository containing:
- Course website (GitHub Pages)
- HTML slide decks for lectures
- Student assignments
- Case studies
- Additional course resources
- Potentially a course-specific LLM

This is a public repository intended for educational use.

## Common Development Tasks

### GitHub Pages Commands
```bash
# Preview the site locally (once Jekyll is set up)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Build the site
bundle exec jekyll build
```

### Working with Course Content
- **Slide Decks**: HTML-based presentations (likely using reveal.js or similar)
- **Assignments**: Markdown or HTML files with course assignments
- **Case Studies**: Interactive or static content for global health scenarios

## Repository Structure (to be established)

Recommended structure for course materials:
- `/docs` or root - GitHub Pages site content
- `/slides` - HTML slide decks
- `/assignments` - Course assignments
- `/case-studies` - Global health case studies
- `/resources` - Additional materials
- `/assets` - Images, CSS, JavaScript

## Key Considerations

1. **Educational Context**: This is course material for Duke University students studying global health
2. **Public Access**: All content should be appropriate for public viewing
3. **Accessibility**: Course materials should follow web accessibility guidelines
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Many students may access materials on mobile devices

## Technology Stack (to be determined)

Likely technologies for this educational repository:
- GitHub Pages (Jekyll static site generator)
- HTML5 for slide presentations (reveal.js, deck.js, or similar)
- Markdown for content authoring
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactive elements
